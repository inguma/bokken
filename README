Bokken is a GUI for the Radare project so it offers almost all the same features that Radare
has and and some of the Radare's ones. It's intended to be a basic disassembler, mainly, to analyze
malware and vulnerabilities.

Currently Bokken is neither an hexadecimal editor nor a full featured disassembler YET, so it should
not be used for deep code analysis or to try to modify files with it.
