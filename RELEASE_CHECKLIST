Things to do in order to release Bokken
=======================================

(All the following examples are made with 1.5, please change it accordingly)

* Start writing a blog post in http://ingumadev.blogspot.com.  Our blog posts have to be always accompanied
  by screenshots of the new features.  Review the existing images in Redmine and either replace
  them or add more to the wiki.

* Tag the final release in mercurial:

hg tag -m "Tagged 1.5 release." 1.5
hg push

* Make a tar.gz and upload it to Redmine as bokken-1.5.tar.gz and under PROPER Version (1.5 in this case).

* Publish the blog post once you have the download link.

* Based on the post, write a simple new News entry in http://bokken.eu/projects/bokken/news/new
  and refer to the blog article for further information.  See http://inguma.eu/news/6 as an example.

* Tweet about the new release and point to the blog post.

* Go to http://freshmeat.net/projects/bokken:
  - Click on "Edit this project" (http://freshmeat.net/projects/bokken/edit), and change the "Latest release"
    link to the new one.
  - Click on "Submit a release" (http://freshmeat.net/projects/bokken/releases/new) and fill out the text
    field with short sentences about the release.  Note that Freshmeat does not respect new lines, so
    everything will appear as a long sentence.  If you are in doubt, preview your changes or see other
    releases.

* Go to the Roadmap page (http://inguma.eu/projects/bokken/roadmap) and move all the open bugs (if any!)
  in the already-released version to the next one.  You can do it in bulk from the UI.  Click on "X open bugs",
  and then select all of them (you can do it by clicking on a blank part in the first Subject field, then
  Shift-click in the last issue, and then right-click...Target version...2.0).

* Go back to the Roadmap page and move all the closed bugs in the Open Backlog (if any) into the
  already-released version.  Same as above, click "N closed", then select all and assign them to 1.5.

* Go to Redmine, to the Versions tab under Settings (http://inguma.eu/projects/bokken/settings/versions) and
  close the current version and add the new one with the proposed schedule.

* Take a breath.
